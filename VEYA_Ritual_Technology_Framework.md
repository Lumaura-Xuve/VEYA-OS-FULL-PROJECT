# VEYA Ritual Technology Framework

## Introduction to Ritual Technology

The VEYA Ritual Technology Framework represents a pioneering approach to technological interaction, transforming standard digital experiences into meaningful ceremonies that facilitate genuine transformation. This framework forms a core differentiator for the VEYA ecosystem, elevating everyday interactions into sacred experiences.

## Core Principles of Ritual Technology

## Ritual Technology Implementation

### Ritual Construction Framework

The technical backbone of VEYA's ritual technology is the Ritual Construction Framework (RCF), which provides a standardized approach to ceremony creation:

```javascript
// Example Ritual Construction Framework
import { RitualEngine } from '@veya/ritual';

// Define a ritual template
const morningIntentionRitual = new RitualEngine.Template({
  name: 'Morning Intention Setting',
  duration: '5-10 minutes',
  elements: [
    {
      type: 'breathing',
      pattern: '4-7-8',
      duration: 60, // seconds
      guidance: true
    },
    {
      type: 'intention',
      prompt: 'What quality do you wish to embody today?',
      storage: 'daily-intention',
      visualization: true
    },
    {
      type: 'embodiment',
      action: 'place hand on heart',
      duration: 30,
      audioGuidance: true
    },
    {
      type: 'declaration',
      source: 'daily-intention',
      format: 'Today, I embody [intention]',
      recordAudio: true
    },
    {
      type: 'closure',
      action: 'three deep breaths',
      transitionTo: 'Heartline'
    }
  ],
  settings: {
    ambience: 'morning',
    musicTrack: 'gentle-awakening',
    visualTheme: 'sunrise',
    tokenReward: 2
  }
});

// Personalize the ritual for a user
const userRitual = morningIntentionRitual.personalize({
  userId: currentUser.id,
  adaptations: {
    breathingPattern: userPreferences.breathing || '4-7-8',
    musicEnabled: userPreferences.music,
    visualStyle: userPreferences.visual || 'cosmic'
  }
